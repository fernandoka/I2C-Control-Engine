# I2C-Control-Engine
My final project of the subject Embeded Systems (Facultad de Informatic, Madrid).
The project implements a light control of the step engine using 3 sensors (LDR, Pot1, Pot2). Using a LCD panel, the systems shows the ambient temperature(reading the LM35). The protocol to read theses sensors is I2C. At first the systems request a code, depending if you fail or not, the system will play two diferents songs and after the control system will start or not.
